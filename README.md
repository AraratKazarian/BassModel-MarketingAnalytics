**Bass Model - Markering Analytics**  

This project was developed as part of the **DS223 Marketing Analytics** course at the **American University of Armenia**. It focuses on building and analyzing a **Bass Diffusion Model** for market forecasting, leveraging historical data and innovation parallels in the supply chain industry.  

**Project Overview**  
The project draws inspiration from the **ArcBest Vaux System**, recognized as one of Timeâ€™s Best Inventions of 2023, and its historical parallel, the forklift. Both innovations represent significant advancements in material handling and logistics efficiency, sharing a common goal of streamlining operations through automation.  

Key elements of the project include:  
- **Market Context**: Examining the forklift market as a historical analogy to the Vaux System, highlighting their shared impact on the logistics and supply chain industries.  
- **Dataset**: The dataset, sourced from **Statista**, contains global forklift market volume data from 2018 to 2022, with forecasts up to 2032. The data is segmented by region: North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Rest of the World. A cleaned version, **Modified_data.csv**, includes an additional **Total Sales** column aggregating regional sales.  
- **Bass Diffusion Modeling**: Using the cleaned dataset, a Bass Model was developed to analyze adoption trends and forecast market growth in the forklift industry.  

**Purpose and Insights**  
This project bridges theoretical concepts in marketing analytics with real-world applications. By modeling adoption patterns in the forklift market, we draw valuable insights into how innovations like the ArcBest Vaux System may follow similar trajectories, helping stakeholders in logistics and supply chain industries anticipate and plan for market changes.  

This project demonstrates expertise in **data cleaning**, **forecasting**, and the application of **marketing analytics models** to real-world datasets.
